# LAI Detector
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 

## Background
Today we have a real concern that the democracy is decreasing. A big reason for this might be a contempt for politicians, and a belief that they lie and don't speak truthfully. There is also a problem with alternative new sites that report alternative versions of truth.

## How is it used?
If speech input, it is first translated to text. Text is then analyzed first using NLP to understand the meaning of the text. Then this text is being verified using all available BIG DATA informationIf speech input, it is first translated to text. Then the text is analyzed first using NLP to understand the meaning of the text. Then this text is being verified for truthfulness using all available BIG DATA information. The result is then presented on the fly, summarizing what might be wrong in the statements (might be several different options), correct these wrongs with possible truths, in case of uncertainty, predict a possibility value for truthfulness. 
This would allow listeners to react on lies and untruths to be able to ask counter-questions . It would help in case of arguments which statement to believe in. In the end, it would be harder to get away with lying.

## Challenges
In case of particular domain knowledge, e.g. for politicinas specific economc figures not available for the public, it might not be possible to have the correct data to verify lies against.

## What next?
I think the usefulness is great for this AI-tool. It's a fact controller tool, not only to spot possible lies, but also to correct wrong information and misunderstandings.
